        i had this dream when i was 8. im 19 now, so you know<br>
        how traumatizing this must have been for it to be<br>
        so terminally engrained in my memory.<br>
            <br>
        still one of the most horrifying<br>
        nightmares i've ever had<br>
        til this day.

        fire. crashes. pitch dark sky full of screams. i sat in a broken car, desperately trying to ignore<br>
        the rotting bodies one window away from me. my head pulsated to the rhythm of my<br>
        heartbeat. mom said she just needs to grab some canned food in the<br>
        supermarket, then she will come back to me. we will drive away,<br>
        and i will be<br>
            <br>
        safe.<br>
            <br>
        suddenly my perspective shifted. i was above all else. i saw the car burried in infected people.<br>
        i saw people from afar screaming and crying, running for their lives.<br>
        i heard the sound of fire dancing on flesh. living flesh; rotting flesh.<br>
        i heard the sound of people gnawing on other people.<br>
            <br>
        i saw my mother fighting her way to our car.<br>
        i saw my mother, her dress torn, her hair pulled–––––<br>
            <br>
        i saw her crumbled, rot, languised.
